# 12-Week Rust Learning Plan for My Child

## Preparation Week: Setting Up

**Activities:**

- Install Rust using rustup (https://rustup.rs/)
- Install Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension
- Create a GitHub account to save progress
- Review basic Logo concepts your child already knows

**Resources to Gather:**

- The Rust Book (online): https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
- Rustlings exercises: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/

## Week 1: Hello, Rust!

**Learning Goals:**

- Understand what Rust is and why it's useful
- Create and run a first Rust program
- Learn about variables and basic data types

**Activities:**

1. Introduction to Rust and its benefits
2. Create and run "Hello, World!" program
3. Explore variables and basic data types
4. Draw comparisons between Logo and Rust

**Exercises:**

1. Modify the "Hello, World!" program to print your name
2. Create variables for age, favourite colour, and a hobby
3. Print all variables with descriptive text

**Weekend Project:**
Build a simple "About Me" program that asks for input and responds with facts about the user.

## Week 2: Control Flow

**Learning Goals:**

- Use if/else statements
- Work with loops (for, while)
- Understand basic expressions

**Activities:**

1. Explore if/else statements with examples
2. Learn about loops and when to use each type
3. Compare Logo loops to Rust loops

**Exercises:**

1. Create a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero
2. Write a loop that counts from 1 to 10
3. Create a "FizzBuzz" program (print Fizz for multiples of 3, Buzz for multiples of 5, and FizzBuzz for multiples of both)

**Weekend Project:**
Build a simple number guessing game (first version).

## Week 3: Functions

**Learning Goals:**

- Create and call functions
- Pass parameters and return values
- Understand function signatures

**Activities:**

1. Explore function definitions and calls
2. Learn about parameters and return types
3. Create helper functions for existing programs

**Exercises:**

1. Create a function that squares a number
2. Write a function that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit
3. Refactor the FizzBuzz program to use functions

**Weekend Project:**
Start building the Turtle drawing simulator (part 1) - creating the turtle and basic movement functions.

## Week 4: Tuples, Arrays, and Vectors

**Learning Goals:**

- Work with compound data types
- Understand when to use each data structure
- Learn about indexing and iteration

**Activities:**

1. Explore tuples for fixed collections of different types
2. Learn about arrays for fixed-size collections
3. Use vectors for dynamic collections

**Exercises:**

1. Create a tuple to store a (x,y) coordinate and access its components
2. Create an array of your favourite foods and print them
3. Build a shopping list using a vector

**Weekend Project:**
Enhance the Turtle drawing simulator (part 2) - adding functions to draw shapes.

## Week 5: Ownership (Part 1)

**Learning Goals:**

- Understand Rust's ownership system
- Learn about variables and scope
- Explore how memory works in Rust

**Activities:**

1. Introduction to ownership with visual examples
2. Explore how variables are created and destroyed
3. Learn about the "move" concept

**Exercises:**

1. Experiment with creating variables and moving values
2. Trace memory usage in simple programs
3. Identify ownership issues in code snippets

**Weekend Project:**
Create a simple text-based menu system for a restaurant.

## Week 6: Ownership (Part 2) - Borrowing

**Learning Goals:**

- Understand references and borrowing
- Learn about mutable and immutable references
- Prevent common errors with the borrow checker

**Activities:**

1. Introduction to references with &
2. Learn about mutable references with &mut
3. Explore the rules of borrowing

**Exercises:**

1. Refactor previous programs to use references
2. Create functions that borrow values instead of taking ownership
3. Fix broken code with borrowing issues

**Weekend Project:**
Build a simple address book program that stores names and phone numbers.

## Week 7: Structs and Methods

**Learning Goals:**

- Create custom data types with structs
- Implement methods for structs
- Organise related data and functionality

**Activities:**

1. Define structs to represent objects
2. Add methods to structs with impl
3. Create instances of structs

**Exercises:**

1. Create a Person struct with name, age, and favourite colour
2. Add methods to greet and describe the person
3. Create multiple Person instances and call their methods

**Weekend Project:**
Enhance the Turtle drawing simulator (part 3) - converting to a
