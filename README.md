# Teaching Rust to My Child

## Preparation (1 Week) – Transfer Logo Knowledge to Rust

- Review what she knows from [Logo](https://turtleacademy.com) (loops, variables, functions).
- Introduce Rust in simple terms—just another way to "talk to the computer."
- Set up Rust (use [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) first).
- Show basic output (`print!`) and connect it to Logo commands.

## Phase 1: Basics with Visuals (2-3 Weeks)

Goal: Learn Rust basics through drawing.
- Teach variables, loops, and functions using simple graphics ([`turtle-rs`](https://turtle.rs/)).
- Project: Draw patterns with loops, like in Logo.

## Phase 2: Control Flow & Interaction (2-3 Weeks)

Goal: Add logic and user input.
- Introduce `if`/`else` statements and basic user input.
- Project: Extend the drawing program to change shapes based on input.

## Phase 3: Ownership & Borrowing (3-4 Weeks)

Goal: Introduce Rust's core memory concepts in simple ways.
- Use toy-sharing analogies to explain ownership.
- Teach mutable vs immutable with simple shape-changing examples.
- Project: Make a shape that “borrows” attributes like size or colour.

## Phase 4: Build a Fun Project (4-6 Weeks)

Goal: Apply everything in a small game or animated project.
- Encourage her to create a game, art piece, or interactive program.
- Use Rustlings exercises for practice.
- Project: A mini game or simulation (her choice!).
